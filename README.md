# nvimconfig
amazing config for the best editor in the whole universe

# what is in the box?
This is my fully configured neovim config.
- configured native lsp
- splitted config files for quick access
- telescope
- workspaces
- barbar tabs
- terminal popup with <C-t>
- Lazygit integration with <C-g>
- Leaderkey is space (<space-ff> for telescope)
- Has gruvbox, has tokyonight colorschemes
- Lots of remaps, mostly suggested by the primeagen and his degenerated community (including myself)
